# __Terragear FAQ:__

## Why isn't it loading for me? All it displays is a black screen/indefinite loading screen.
If you are on an Apple device (iOS, iPad OS, MacOS) this is due to Apple deprecating support for OpenGL 2.0. Currently, Godot 4.0 has no solution for this unlike previous versions due to upstream issues, so you may have to wait a few months until Godot updates to get it to work.
If you are not on Apple, please raise a bug report here: https://github.com/lunauii/terragear/issues

## The layout is super stretched on mobile.
This has been fixed in release-v0.2.0.0, so please wait until I finish it.

## The buttons don't work/don't do anything.
This is intentional, as I haven't added functionality yet. Please wait until release-v1.0.0.0 to see guides.

## What was this coded in?
I used Godot 4 and its built in language, GDScript. For deploying online, I used GitHub Pages and itch.io, and exported the tool as a web app.

## How can I contribute?
